Both A and B are predictor, 
there are 3 variables in GGM:


Mean (μ):
Each Gaussian component has a mean vector with D elements, so this contributes D parameters per component. 

Covariance Matrix (Σ):
Each component also has a covariance matrix, which has D*(D-1)/2 unique parameters. 

Mixing Coefficients (π):
To combine the different Gaussian components, we need K-1 mixing coefficients, as the last coefficient is automatically determined by the constraint that they sum to 1. 

The maximum disagreement between two clustering for a dataset of that size is:(n*n-1)/2:
